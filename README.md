# Shopify 2.0 Skeleton Theme

This is a starter theme structure for devs wanting to code Shopify 2.0 themes from scratch



## Requirements

[Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/getting-started#install-shopify-cli)

## Installation

#### On your local Machine
* First clone this repository and then navigate to the theme's directory on your local machine.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nairdaee/Shopify-2.0-Skeleton-Theme.git
  cd Shopify-2.0-Skeleton-Theme
  code .
```
* Next, [login](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/getting-started#authenticate) to your shopify store

* Now any Shopify CLI theme command that you run uses the theme in our `Shopify-2.0-Skeleton-Theme` directory.


#### Directly to your Shopify store
* Download the .zip file for this repository

* Log into your store and navigate to `/admin/themes`

* Under theme library click on `Add theme` and select `Upload zip file`
* Select the zip file you downloaded and wait for it to be added to your themes.
* You can now go ahead and customize your theme

## Usage/editorials

####  Creating sections:
* First go to the `sections` folder and create the section you want inside i.e `editorial.liquid`
* Inside the .liquid file you have just created add the following code(ensure that the sections.`editorial`.name matches your file name):
```liquid
{% schema %}
{
  "name": "t:sections.editorial.name",
  "tag": "section",
  "class": "section"
}
{% endschema %}
```
* If the section you are creating is static(no dynamic content will be added later, mostly used for announcement bars, navbars and footers). Then the schema is not required. Instead you'll manually extend inside the `layout/theme.liquid` file like shown below:

```html
<body>
<!-- Ensure the section is inside the body tag -->
{% section 'editorial' %}
</body>
```
* If your sections are dynamic then we need to add them to the `templates/`. For example, if you want to add the editorial page. First create a new file called `editorial.json` under the `templates/` folder and add the following:
```html
{
  "sections": {},
  "order": []
}

```

* Inside the `editorial.json`, under sections, add the following code:
```html
"editorial": {
  <!-- no comma at the end if there's only one item -->
      "type": "editorial"
    }
```

* Lastly, under `"order"` add:
```html
<!-- no comma at the end if there's only one item -->
    "editorial"
```
* You can now see your page when you do a `shopify theme serve` and go to the url `/editorial`

####  Adding your styles:
* Now you'll need to add your css. This is achieved by adding a `.css` file inside the `assets/` folder. In our case, it will be called `editorial.css`
* To import it into our `.liquid` section file. We use the following code at the very top of our .liquid file:
```
{{ 'editorial.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
```
* For inline styles, you can use the styles tag i.e:
```css
{% style %}
/* Add your styles here */
{% endstyle %}
```
